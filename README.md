bunch of casino games that i made in python
wed, sep 17, 2025 - if you're reading this, it means i finally finished the goddamn program. if you're not, hello jude in the future!!! anyways, i spent an hour trying to figure out how to quit the program from within a loop but couldn't and i think it's an issue with the while loops themselves and not my code so we'll figure that out later. i'll use test.py if i need to. god save me.
